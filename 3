Steps: 
1. Create a New Cluster: 
• Log into Sunstone and go to "Clusters" under the "Resources" section. 
• Click "Create", give the cluster a name (e.g., Lab-Cluster), and select the hypervisor (e.g., KVM). 
2. Add Virtual Machines to the Cluster: 
• Create new VMs or migrate existing VMs to the new cluster. 
• Assign VMs based on their resource needs (e.g., 2 CPU, 4GB RAM, 20GB disk). 
• You can also use VM Templates to quickly deploy multiple VMs on the cluster. 
3. Create and Attach Storage Pools: 
• Go to "Storage" and create a new storage pool (e.g., Datastore-1). 
• Attach the storage pool to your cluster to make it available for VM disk storage. 
• When creating a VM, select the appropriate storage from the available pools.
4. Create and Attach Virtual Networks: 
• Create a virtual network (as shown in Lab 2) and assign it to the new cluster.  
• When creating a VM, select the network for the VM's connectivity. 
5. Monitor the Virtual Data Center: 
• Go to "Clusters", select your cluster, and monitor the resource utilization (CPU, RAM, storage). 
• Check the status of the VMs, storage, and network.
