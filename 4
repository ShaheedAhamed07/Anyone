Creating a Hybrid Cloud with OpenNebula 
Steps: 
1. Set Up OpenNebula: 
• Ensure OpenNebula is installed and Sunstone is configured. 
• Set up a local host for running VMs. 
2. Configure Public Cloud Integration: 
• Log into Sunstone and go to "Storage" → "Marketplace". 
• Import a public cloud appliance (e.g., Ubuntu from AWS). 
• Configure the appliance for hybrid deployment. 
3. Deploy VMs in the Hybrid Cloud: 
• Create a new VM template that uses the public cloud image. 
• Deploy VMs using this template and monitor the status in Sunstone. 
4. Verify Hybrid Setup: 
• Access the public cloud VM via SSH using its public IP. 
• Ensure data and configurations are synchronized between the local and public clouds.
